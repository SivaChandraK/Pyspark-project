Spark MLlib Project: Predictive Modeling on Adult Dataset
•	Employed Apache Spark and MLlib to load, clean, and preprocess the "adult dataset," handling missing values and transforming features into vectors with one-hot encoding.
•	Developed and fine-tuned predictive models, including logistic regression and gradient-boosted trees, utilizing grid parameter search and cross-validation for optimal hyperparameter tuning.
•	Demonstrated expertise in distributed computing, feature engineering, and model optimization, achieving high accuracy in predicting income levels.
